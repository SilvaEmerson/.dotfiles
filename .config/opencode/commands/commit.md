description: git or jujutsu commit
subtask: true
---
commit in jj in case of a jujutsu repository, otherwise use git 
make sure it includes a prefix like
docs:
tui:
core:
ci:
ignore:
wip:
For anything in the packages/web use the docs: prefix.
For anything in the packages/app use the ignore: prefix.
prefer to explain WHY something was done from an end user perspective instead of
WHAT was done.
do not do generic messages like "improved agent experience" be very specific
about what user facing changes were made
